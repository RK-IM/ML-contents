This is a reference to the codes in video numbers 73 to 78 of [This Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZsOBAyNTZwbR08R959iCvYT3qzhxvGOE).  
In the video, he uses Tensorflow to code, but I use Pytorch instead.  
Dataset is from kaggle [2018 Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-science-bowl-2018/overview) segmenting nuclei.
This code uses only Stage 1 dataset of full data.
